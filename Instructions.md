# Instructions

I suggest you do the following to get started, working together.  
 
* draw the look of your GUI on a whiteboard. If it has multiple screens, draw each one. Take a photo
* write a list of the operations that the program will need to handle.  For each, write down
  * who causes the action (e.g., the user, the program, etc)
  * what is the action (e.g., startup, roll the dice, play a turn in game, etc)
  * what happens because of the action (e.g., reads data file, updates UI, updates internal state, declares winner, etc)
* agree how you will start breaking the code into separate classes to support these actions
* make a rough division of labor, what are the main tasks and who will start doing each one
* agree when to meet next and how often to meet (every 2-3 days or more frequently. weekly is too long)
* put all this info in a shared document (include your names and contact info, name of project, etc)

Then share it to me by email.  This will get you started.

These GitHub Classroom repositories are created to help you coordinate your coding.  I have created a master branch, 
plus one branch per person on the team (using your email address as the branch name).  I suggest you clone the repo to 
your local machine, checkout your named branch, and do work there (committing when you have code that works).  Periodically
you will push your branch to 'origin' (this shared repo) and issue a pull-request to have your code reviewed and merged 
into master in the shared repo.  Then everyone can update to your shared code.  I'll give detailed instructions soon.

Please see me or email to ask about using GitHub to coordinate your coding. Don't let it stop you from writing code!
